# Sherlock

Sherlock v1.

Tested with Python 3.8.3 on Linux Ubuntu 20.04.  Create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv .venv`; then activate it with `source .venv\bin\activate`.  Next, use `pip install .` to install dependencies. Use the `python main.py` file as a starting point from the `src` folder, and use the option -h/--help to see available options.

You can also use a Jupyter notebook, see `Example.ipynb`.

Design spaces are organized in CSV files; the objective values in the input file will be minimized.
