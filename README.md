# Sherlock

Sherlock v1.

Tested with Python 3.6.5 on Linux Ubuntu. Use the `main.py` file as a starting point, and use the option -h/--help to see available options.

You can also use a Jupyter notebook, see `Example.ipynb`.

Design spaces are organized in CSV files; the objective values in the input file will be minimized.
