# Sherlock

Sherlock v1.

Tested with Python 3.8.3 on Linux Ubuntu 20.04.  Use `poetry install` to install dependencies.  Then use `poetry shell` to enter the virtual environment. Use the `python main.py` file as a starting point from the `src` folder, and use the option -h/--help to see available options.

You can also use a Jupyter notebook, see `Example.ipynb`.

Design spaces are organized in CSV files; the objective values in the input file will be minimized.
